# Fundamentals of Computer Programming - Portfolio
This repository documents an 8-week progression through the FOCP course. 
# Week 1: Getting Started

Basic Syntax: Writing and executing initial programs using print().

Arithmetic: Utilizing Python as a calculator (using +, -, *, /, and ** for exponents).

Order of Operations: Implementing parentheses () to control mathematical precedence.

Error Handling: Implementing try/except blocks to prevent crashes, such as handling division by zero errors.

# Week 2: Variables & Data

Focused on storing and understanding data.

Variables: Creating and updating variables (e.g., total = 100).

Data Types: Working with Integers, Floats, Strings, and Booleans.

Type Checking: Using the type() function to verify data formats.

# Week 3: Making Decisions & Loops

Comparisons: Evaluating relationships between values using operators like ==, >, and <.

Conditional Logic: Using if, elif, and else statements to direct program flow.

Iteration:

for loops: For iterating a set number of times.

while loops: For iterating based on a condition.

Flow Control: Managing loops using break to exit and continue to skip iterations.

# Week 4: Using Built-in Modules

Importing: Accessing external libraries using import math.

Selective Import: Loading specific functions, such as from math import sqrt.

Mathematical Tools: Performing advanced calculations like square roots, logarithms, and utilizing constants like Pi.

# Week 5: Writing Custom Modules

Functions: Defining custom blocks of code using def.

Custom Modules: Created a distinct utility file, My_utils.py, containing an average() function.

Testing: Developed scripts to import and test the custom module against various data sets.

# Week 6: Mastering Lists

Advanced list manipulation techniques is covered.

Modification: Adding items via append() or insert().

Management: Removing elements using pop() or remove().

Organization: Sorting lists numerically or alphabetically.

# Week 7: Working with Sets

Focused on handling unique collections of data.

Uniqueness: Using Sets to automatically filter out duplicate entries.

Set Operations: Applying mathematical concepts like Union and Intersection.

# Week 8: Files & Formatting

This final week covers persistent data and presentation.

File I/O: Opening files in write mode (w) to save data and read mode (r) to retrieve it.

Formatting: Utilizing f-strings for clean, readable output (e.g., f"Result: {value}").
