# Python Programming Tasks
This repository contains two simple Python codes created for a programming project of FOCP.

# Task 1: Pizza Offer Calculator (task1.py)
This code calculates the final bill for the "Beckett Pizza Plaza" 4-for-3 promotion.

How it works:

It asks the user to input prices for 4 different pizzas.

It automatically finds the cheapest pizza and deducts that amount (the "saving").

It calculates the final total and the percentage saved (rounded up).

It handles errors if the user enters text instead of numbers.

# Task 2: Security Check (task2.py)
This code simulates a specific password verification process.

How it works:

The user sets a password (must be at least 9 characters long).

The program then picks 3 random positions (indexes) from that password.

The user must enter the correct character for each requested position.

If all 3 checks are correct, the security check passes. If any are wrong, it fails.

# How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. You can run the files from your terminal:

Bash

# Run the pizza calculator
python task1.py

# Run the password checker
python task2.py
